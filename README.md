## 👋 Hi there! I'm Axel Jordano

🧠 I'm an AI Engineer and indie creator passionate about building intelligent systems and meaningful digital products.  
💻 I specialize in AI development, backend systems, and product prototyping using technologies like Node.js, Python, Langchain, and PostgreSQL.

🚀 Currently, I'm working on **Cashly**, an AI-powered personal finance assistant designed to not only help users manage their money, but also guide their emotional relationship with spending and savings.  
Built with a microservices architecture and powered by Node.js, Langchain, PostgreSQL and modern frontend frameworks, Cashly aims to **inspire better decisions** through data, psychology and intelligent feedback.

📚 I’m constantly learning and experimenting with:
- Applied AI (RAG pipelines, LLM agents, embeddings)
- System architecture & backend scalability
- SaaS product development & solo entrepreneurship

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on exciting AI, backend or indie projects — feel free to reach out!

🎯 My mission is to build useful AI tools that empower people — whether it's for mental well-being, productivity, or financial self-awareness.

🧩 Technologies I’ve worked with:
 NestJs (Nodejs), Angular (NodeJs), Java (as backend), C#, ASP.NET Core, Kotlin (as backend), Python, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server, Redis

🌱 Currently diving deeper into:
- AI product design
- LLMS, AI Agents, LangGraph, GraphQL, MCP protocol and advanced typescript.
- Indie hacking strategies to launch and monetize MVPs
